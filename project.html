                    CRUD stands for <b>Create, Read, Update & Delete.</b> These are the four basic operations which are executed on Database Models.<br>
                    We are developing a web app which is capable of performing these operations.  The ability of the application to read data form<br>
                    the database.

                    Our initial set-up till now created the development environment our app will rely on.<br>
                    To create the web application, you will run another Django command that automatically generates the basic structure of a web
                    application.

                    The EMAIL_HOST_USER AND EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD settings, if set, are used to authenticate to the SMTP server,<br>
                    and the EMIL_USE_TLS and EMAIL_SSL settings control whether a secure connection is used.

                <dt>Food order website</dt>
                <dd>
                    This Food Order Website is a static web page that displays a list of food items and allows users<br>
                    to place orders by clicking the "Order Now" button next to each item. The menu items are generated<br>
                    dynamically using JavaScript, and when a user clicks the button, an alert message informs them of their order.
                    The HTML file provides the basic structure of the website.
                    It includes a title, references to CSS and JavaScript files, and a element with the id menu where the food items are dynamically added.
                    Bootstrap CSS framework is included from a CDN to facilitate responsive design.
                    The CSS file contains styles for the website elements.
                    It styles the body, sets the font-family, and defines the appearance of menu items and the order button.
